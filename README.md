This is a basic django project which I hope to be able to develop to help me manage my scout group better because the available options (Scouting Ireland's MMS and OSM) don't do what group leaders need. Well, they don't do what I need anyway!

Hopefully the app will eventually include:
* __Scout and Scouter management__ Ability to add scout and scouters, parents/guardians and emergency contacts and extra information
* __Badge tracking__ with a simple checkbox interface to record what scouts have done what adventure skill components and also details of special interest badges, chief scout and maritime badges
* __section projections__ project when scouts will be changing sections and future sizes of sections
* __attendance__
* __other stuff__...

I've only spent a few hours at this so far so not much works :) If you are interested get in touch / fork
